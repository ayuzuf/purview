# Risk Assessment and Impact Analysis

## Overview

This section provides a comprehensive risk assessment and impact analysis for implementing Microsoft Purview DLP and Sensitivity Labels within a FTSE 100 financial services organization. Understanding and mitigating risks while managing impacts is critical to ensuring a successful implementation that meets regulatory requirements without disrupting business operations.

## Risk Assessment Framework

### Risk Categories

The risk assessment framework addresses five key risk categories specific to Microsoft Purview implementation in financial services:

1. **Implementation Risks**: Risks associated with the technical deployment and configuration
2. **Operational Risks**: Risks related to ongoing operations and management
3. **Compliance Risks**: Risks related to regulatory requirements and compliance obligations
4. **Business Risks**: Risks affecting business processes and productivity
5. **Security Risks**: Risks related to data protection effectiveness and security posture

### Risk Evaluation Methodology

Each identified risk is evaluated using the following criteria:

- **Probability**: Likelihood of the risk occurring (Low, Medium, High)
- **Impact**: Potential consequences if the risk materializes (Low, Medium, High)
- **Risk Level**: Combined assessment of probability and impact (Low, Medium, High, Critical)
- **Risk Owner**: Individual or team responsible for risk management
- **Mitigation Strategy**: Approach to reduce probability or impact
- **Contingency Plan**: Actions to take if the risk materializes
